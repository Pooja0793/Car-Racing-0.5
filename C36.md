# C36 Basic Structure

For this small part of our game, where are we asking the players to login, what are the different objects that can be in our game? What will their properties and functions be?

We need to have at least 3 objects- 

##### 1)Form
* Form should contain the input box and a button to log in. ● When the button is pressed, the player's name should be registered in the database and a new player should be created.

##### 2) Player

* A new player object should be created every time a new user logs in. It should contain all the information about the player - name, position in the game etc.
* For now it can just have the name property. It should also be able to read and write player information to the database - for example player count or player name.

##### 3) Game Object

* Game object should be able to hold the state of the game. It should be able to -
* display form when the game state is 0(WAIT) i.e. it should read the gameState from the dB.
* display the game when the game state is 1(PLAY) i.e. it is able to update the gameState in dB.
* display leaderboard when the game state is 2(END).

For now, we will only consider the case when the game state is 0.



We will make changes to the database created in the last class in this way:

JSON format 

{

gameState: 0,

playerCount: 0, 

player1: { name   :   ""   }, 

player2: { name    :  ""  },

 .... 

} 



# Game Class

Initially we will create the constructor empty. We only need functions

* read the gameState from the dB to get the game state .

​         So we have a **getState()** will read the gameState value from the dB.

* **update(state)** , this function is used to update the game state passed in the parenthesis  in the dB.
* -> databaseReference.on() creates a listener which keeps listening to the gameState from the database.
* -> databaseReference.update() will update the database reference. Here "/" refers to the main database inside which gameState is created.
* start():  When gameState is 0 then start() function will display the form where user will log in details and create new player object as soon as the player logs in. And will also get the playerCount using getCount() for every new player.



# Form Class

We will use HTML to display a form like thing. Html has certain tags,h1,h2,h3...,input,button. etc. **DOM (Document Object Model)** is the basic html structure n we will be using **p5.dom.min** library to implement this.

* title
* create headings
* change html content
* position the html content

Same is done for button and input box .

* button.mousePressed(function)
* function will hide button,input. playerCount increases, update playerCount and name inputted in dB, display greeting.

# Player Class

* getCount() to get the playerCount from dB
* updateCount() to update the playerCount in dB.
* update(name) function to update name in dB, for this new entries are required in the dB for new player, eg. player1 ,player2,player3...so on.

Diff between set and update functions for the dB.



# sketch.js

Let's create new Game object for our Game class and get the game state and start our game. 

game = new Game();

game.getState();

game.start();
